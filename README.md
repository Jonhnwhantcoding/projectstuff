      <ul> 
        <li> <strong>  On 14 March 1879 </strong>  Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire </li>
        <li> <strong> In 1894 </strong>  Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard.[17] The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. </li> 
        <li> <strong>  In 1895  </strong> at the age of 16, Einstein sat the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,[21] but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. </li>
        <li> <strong>  1903 </strong>  Einstein and Marić married in January  <strong>  In May 1904 </strong>  their first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zürich<strong> in July 1910. </strong> </strong> In 1914, </strong>  the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zürich with their sons. 
<li> <strong> 1825 </strong> was diagnosed  wtih schizophrenia </li>
<li> <strong>  In 1910 </strong> he wrote poem "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be" while wife was pregnant with their seconde child eduard </li>
<li> <strong> In 1900 </strong> he graduated  Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901 
<li> <strong> 1921–1922 </strong> travels abroad </li>
<li> <strong>  On 2 April 1921 </strong> Eisntein visited new-york for the first time </li>
<li> 
<li> <strong> In july 1921 </strong> he also published essay "My First Impression of the U.S.A" in which she descirebd about  some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville," </li>
<li> <strong> 1930–1931 </strong>  isited to america seconde time  visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the U.S., he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.</li>
<li> <strong> In February 1933  </strong> while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler  </li>
<li> <strong> In April 1933, </strong>  Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.[70] Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues," thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.[59] </li> 
<li> <strong>  In 1939 </strong> a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research.  </li>
<li> <strong> In 1940 Einstein </strong>  got american citizenship </li>
<li>  <strong> On 17 April 1955, </strong>  Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[118] He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it </li>   </ul>
 <blockquote>
   <p> "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."[120] He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end" </p>
